            <h2>Terrain Difficulty</h2>
            <p>
              Each pass gives you access to a variety of different terrain, from beginner to expert. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The Ikon pass contains access to resorts with the highest percentage of beginner terrain, and may be best suited towards people who are newer to the sport. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The Epic pass contains access to resorts with the highest percentage of expert terrain, and may be best suited towards people who are more experienced. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The Mountain Collective pass contains access to resorts with a relatively even distribution of terrain difficulty, and may be best suited towards people who are intermediate skiers.

            <p>
              The number of lifts at each resort can impact how long you may be waiting in line at each resort. Here we can see that the Epic pass gives you access to the most lifts, followed by the Ikon pass, and then the Mountain Collective pass. As such it is expected that the Epic pass will give you access to the largest resorts and the lowest waiting times.
